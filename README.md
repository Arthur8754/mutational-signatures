# Mutational signatures as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response

This project is a multi-disciplinary project, with the Biology Faculty of the Sherbrooke University and the MEDomics UdeS lab from the Science Faculty of the Sherbrooke University. It consists of studying the predictive aspect of mutational signatures for the response to an immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatment in colorectal cancers.

## Prerequisites
It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment. To install the useful dependencies for this project, enter this command at the root of the project :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execute the code

### Response prediction
You can execute the following notebook : `predict-response.ipynb`.
